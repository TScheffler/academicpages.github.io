<h2>Course description</h2>

<p>
A central factor of text coherence is the speaker’s/author’s
establishing discourse relations between adjacent portions of text,
e.g., temporal or causal ones. In this class, we will work with two
influential theories of discourse structure that build on such
relations:
<ul>
  <li>The Penn Discourse Tree Bank analyzes explicit and implicit connectives (e.g., because, nevertheless, afterwards)  in text and links them to their arguments, i.e. the text spans that are joined by the relation.
  <li>Rhetorical Structure Theory posits a complete tree structure to
  arise from assigning individual relations to adjacent segments and
  stipulates certain well-formedness constraints for this structure.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In the first phase of the class, we will study both approaches in some detail. Then we’ll select one (or both) and aim for an implementation of a discourse parser. Annotated data (in English and/or German) is available for both approaches.
Importantly, we will apply the parsing task not only to "standard"
newspaper text (as earlier work has done) but also to Social media
data, especially microblogs. This is a new field of application that
investigates the mechanics of conversations and their coherence, for
example on Twitter. 
</p>
<p>
The course grade will be based mainly on the project work in the
second phase of the seminar, and a final report you will write about
it.
