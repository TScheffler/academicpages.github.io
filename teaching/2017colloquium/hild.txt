Past and Current Research With the Humanoid Robot Myon
Manfred Hild, Simon Untergasser (Beuth Hochschule, Berlin)
 
The humanoid robot Myon has been built from scratch as a platform that is fully dedicated to research in Cognitive Systems, Robotics, and Human-Machine-Interaction. We will briefly address the underlying design principles of Myon and shed some light on past collaborative research within the EU project ALEAR (Artificial Language Evolution on Autonomous Robots).
In the main part of the presentation we will first give an overview on current research topics within the Neurorobotics Research Laboratory (NRL) and then focus on a brand new approach where we strive to implement communicative competencies as a multi-modal grounded kernel around which higher-level-systems of the robot will be built, instead of adding speech recognition as a mere tool to control an otherwise self-sufficient robot.
